#+TITLE: OAB bar exam files

these are the plaintext versions of the Brazilian OAB bar exams,
annotated with their answers (and sometimes with which legal documents
support the correct answer).

* format
the format we designed is exemplified by the question below:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Quest√£o [integer] (NULL)?

AREA ([area])?

[paragraph]+
 
OPTIONS

A) [paragraph]

B) [paragraph]

C) [paragraph]

D:CORRECT) [paragraph]
#+END_EXAMPLE

- a =paragraph= is all the text up to a blank line (=\n\n=).

- The =CORRECT= tag indicates the correct answer among the options.

- The marker =NULL= was used to indicate that this question was
  nullified by the organizers.

- We inserted the legal areas that questions pertain to in some
  questions. This is the complete list of all the areas covered on the
  exams:
  - ETHICS
  - PHILOSOPHY
  - CONSTITUTIONAL
  - HUMAN-RIGHTS
  - INTERNATIONAL
  - TAXES
  - ADMINISTRATIVE
  - ENVIRONMENTAL
  - CIVIL
  - CHILDREN
  - CONSUMER
  - BUSINESS
  - CIVIL-PROCEDURE
  - CRIMINAL
  - CRIMINAL-PROCEDURE
  - LABOUR
  - LABOUR-PROCEDURE

* sources
the original PDF exams and answer sheets can be found at several
places on the web; for example, at the [[http://www.oabrj.org.br/banco-de-provas][OAB-RJ website]]. they can also
be found at the [[http://oab.fgv.br/][FGV projetos website]] (FGV projetos is the organization
that has been tasked by OAB with designing the exams in last years).

- In every exam there are 4 different models of test. Each model has
  the same content, however, the questions are presented in a
  different sequential order. That's specially important when you
  check the answer sheet. For this corpus we only used the white model
  or the first model of the exam (named in portuguese as "tipo 1 --
  prova branca").

- On the first, second and third exams the whole test used to have 100
  questions. From the 4th exam onwards the organizers changed the test
  to have a total of 80 questions.

- Before 2010, Brazil did not have a unified OAB Exam. Each State from
  the country used to have his own exam.

- For some reason, the 6th and the 20th exams had problems and they
  were reapplied in some regions of the country. Both the first and
  the reapplication count as the 6th edition. However, these two tests
  had a different content.
