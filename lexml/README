#+TITLE: Brazilian laws

Brazilian laws are written in a plaintext format and then converted to
XML by [[https://github.com/OAB-exams/brazilian-law-parser][this utility]]. their format is simple: one simply has to
separate each 'dispositivo' (título, capítulo, artigo, inciso, etc.)
from the next with a blank line.

the laws have been annotated with any references they make to legal
texts: =[$ $]= denote content that refers to legal text in the same
law, and =[# #]= denote content referring to another legal text.

one can run this sed script to remove these annotations, if desired:
: sed -e 's/\[[$#]//g' -e 's/[$#]\]//g' annotated-law.txt > law.txt
we have made no provisions for escaping as these markers should be
absent from any legal text.
